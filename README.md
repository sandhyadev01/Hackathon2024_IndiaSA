## Business Problem Today
Sales and marketing professionals often struggle to craft personalized emails that effectively engage potential leads, resulting in lower conversion rates and wasted efforts.
A lot of events, mass mails, cold calls ... and then some more!\
A lot of work goes here and a small % gets converted to decent amount of leads which are then sent to SDRs.\
The work doesn't end here.

Issue with this:
- Generic Content & Lack of Personalisation
- Manual Work & Time Constraint
- Limited Data Insights
- Poor Data Segmentation and hence, Limited Audience Targeting
- Ineffective Communication

## What's the cake? 

### Results
You can see customised e-mail templates based on the industry. Also, you can mention your Name(Ex:John Doe) and Designation(Ex: Solutions Architect) for mail generation and a proper mail will be generated along with a MongoDB Customer Story (a.k.a Proof Points üòÉ)
\
This will lead to better conversion rates since the customer now has access to a well-curated response + a proof point to strengthen the response.

That's not all!

The logged in User will be able to see really cool dashboards that gives an overview of deals segregated by their stages, the metrics for # of e-mails sent vs # of e-mail responses.  
<br /><br />
iReach uses cool Search features like Fuzzy Search & Autocomplete Search:
![Fuzzy](https://github.com/sandhyadev01/Hackathon2024_IndiaSA/blob/aee92aeb20d62599693e6f7d9027fdb32974ad91/FuzzySearch_Autocomplete.png)

<br /><br />
Next, a Sales Exec searches for a use-case and generates e-mail for one of the customers. 
The mail content can be curated to be more deal and business-centric.
### _Cherry on the cake: Links to MongoDB Proof Points!_

<br /><br />

Similary, a Solutions Architect can use iReach too for generating a technical e-mail content:

<br /><br />
Up Next: the user will be able to see Dashboards and Charts metrics for their deals in their specific stages, # of mails sent vs responded, outreach reports, etc:
![ChartsDashboard](https://github.com/sandhyadev01/Hackathon2024_IndiaSA/blob/aee92aeb20d62599693e6f7d9027fdb32974ad91/ChartsDashboard.png)

<br /><br />
Psst... Number of e-mails sent and e-mails responded is a chart built on Time-Series Collection.\
**_So, I'm basically looking at Leads Conversion Rate powered by Time-Series Collections ü§ç_**



That's all Folks!\
Fin!
