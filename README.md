## What does iReach do?
Marketing & Sales team works hard to bring in leads from multiple sources. These could possibly be thousands of leads.\
Next, few of these are filtered out(say, a 100) and sent to the SDRs.\
The SDRs then reach out to these leads with common generic responses which may not be relevant to everyone.\
\
Do you see what we're getting at? ðŸ˜„


### iReach:
- _Can help the teams with a curated response - Yep! as per the use-case and stage a deal is in_
- _Here's the cake! AEs (or anyone using iReach) can search from a large set of resources to dig deeper into an Account_
- _With that done, the team can share curated responses and relevant proof points with their customers - ensuring a better conversion rate_
